"""Import/Export module

This module contains the function definitions use for:
    - importing the peers Inventory (list of all the logs the peer has) and their
      Payload(all the peers logs relevant for us) as well as
    - exporting our own Inventory and Payload information during the exchange.
Functions contained in this module are:
    - file_len(fname)
    - createEntry()
    - processEntry()
    - createInventory()
    - sendInventory()
    - receivePeerInventory()
    - createPayload()
    - sendPayload()             TODO
    - receivePeerPayload()
    - sendOk()                  TODO
    - terminate()               TODO
### NOTICE: Everything is still a work-in-progress functions in this module might later be
moved to a more appropriate module
### TODO: It would probably be good to create a Python method which turns .pcap files
into Python objects which can then be parsed and handled easier (i.e. JSON objects)
