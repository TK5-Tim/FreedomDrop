"""Connection Module

This module contains the function definitions used for
    - the device discovery process
    - establishing a connection
###NOTICE: Bluetooth Discovery can take quite a long time (up to 15 seconds)
           It is important to check if the nearby devices are actually discoverable
           (they are not by default, only during the pairing process and the like)
### NOTICE: Everything is still a work-in-progress functions in this module might later be
            moved to a more appropriate module
### TODO: Add SDP(Service Discovery Protocol) functionality
